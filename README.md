# Comparative Experiments
**Implementation Details of Comparative Experiments**

## Introduce

This project primarily involves learning and testing open-source algorithms related to LiDAR SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), as well as adapting them to different models of LiDAR sensors. All components of the project can be compiled and run in environments with Ubuntu 20.04, ROS1, and OpenCV 4.2.
